# Project Brief

## Mission
Build a full-stack web application that helps Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) agents verify that an alcohol label image matches key data submitted in an approval form.

## Core Outcomes
- Collect simplified TTB application data via a user-friendly web form.
- Accept an uploaded label image and run OCR/AI extraction on the text.
- Compare extracted label information with submitted form values to detect matches, mismatches, or missing data.
- Present clear verification results covering success, discrepancies, and error handling.

## Scope Constraints
- Designed for completion within approximately one day; prioritize essential functionality over polish.
- Deployment expected (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Render) with documented local run instructions.
- No persistent storage required; process happens per submission.
