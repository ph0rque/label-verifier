# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Backend OCR pipeline implementation underway; front-end submission flow wired to API.
- Preparing to finalize comparison payloads and results UI components.

## Recent Actions
- Reviewed assignment brief and distilled spirits spec summary.
- Initialized memory bank with project, product, system, tech contexts.
- Drafted comprehensive MVP PRD in `_docs/prd.md`.
- Refined PRD based on stakeholder review:
  - Clarified all four core fields (brand, class/type, ABV, net contents) as MVP-required.
  - Confirmed government warning detection included in MVP baseline (informational only).
  - Made explicit requirement for comprehensive discrepancy reporting (evaluate all fields, no short-circuit).
- Scaffolded Next.js TypeScript project with Tailwind and initial structure.
- Installed OCR, validation, and form handling dependencies (tesseract.js, sharp, zod, react-hook-form).
- Implemented form UI with validation, image upload preview, and styling improvements.
- Created `/api/verify` route with Tesseract.js OCR integration, normalization helpers, and comparison logic for brand, class, ABV, net contents, and government warning.

## Next Steps
- Structure verification response payload and enhance error handling in API route.
- Build results UI components (status badges, mismatch explanations, error states).
- Implement loading indicator and reset workflow in frontend.
- Begin manual testing with sample label images once backend and UI are connected.
