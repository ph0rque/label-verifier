# Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Production deployment successful** with Google Cloud Vision API integration
- All 27 tests passing after fixing product type contradiction detection bug
- Documentation updated with deployment instructions and technical rationale
- Ready for final submission pending deployed URL update in README

## Recent Actions
- **Oct 24, 2025**: Resolved Vercel OCR deployment challenges
  - After 20+ attempts to bundle Tesseract.js for Vercel serverless (worker/WASM path issues), switched to Google Cloud Vision API for production
  - Integrated `@google-cloud/vision` with automatic fallback to local Tesseract.js when API key not present
  - Simplified deployment configuration (removed complex includeFiles bundling)
  - Fixed fuzzy matching bug: "Kentucky Straight Bourbon Beer" vs "Whiskey" now correctly returns not_found
  - Added contradiction detection for product type tokens (Beer vs Whiskey, etc.)
  - Updated README with Google Cloud Vision setup instructions and rationale
  - All 27 tests passing with improved comparison logic

- **Oct 23, 2025**: Major project reorganization
  - Renamed parent folder to `label-verifier` and subfolder from `treasury-label-verifier` to `app`
  - Updated all package metadata (package.json, package-lock.json) to reflect new name
  - Moved README.md to project root and updated all paths for new structure
  - Fixed ESLint configuration (converted to .eslintrc.json for Next.js compatibility)
  - All 26 tests passing with good coverage on core business logic

## Next Steps
- Confirm deployed Vercel instance is working with Google Cloud Vision API key configured
- Update README.md with actual deployed URL
- Final memory bank update with deployment success confirmation
