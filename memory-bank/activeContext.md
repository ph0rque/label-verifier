# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Backend verification pipeline complete; preparing to execute manual testing with sample labels.
- Next priority: finalize deployment readiness and documentation before test pass.

## Recent Actions
- Reviewed assignment brief and distilled spirits spec summary.
- Initialized memory bank with project, product, system, tech contexts.
- Drafted comprehensive MVP PRD in `_docs/prd.md`.
- Refined PRD based on stakeholder review:
  - Clarified all four core fields (brand, class/type, ABV, net contents) as MVP-required.
  - Confirmed government warning detection included in MVP baseline (informational only).
  - Made explicit requirement for comprehensive discrepancy reporting (evaluate all fields, no short-circuit).
- Scaffolded Next.js TypeScript project with Tailwind and initial structure.
- Installed OCR, validation, and form handling dependencies (tesseract.js, sharp, zod, react-hook-form).
- Implemented form UI with validation, image upload preview, and styling improvements.
- Built `/api/verify` route with Tesseract.js OCR integration, normalization, extraction, comparison, structured payloads, and error handling.
- Implemented frontend results presentation with loading states, error messaging, badge styling, and reset workflow.

## Next Steps
- Conduct manual verification tests using `test-images/` assets (perfect match, mismatch, blurry, edge cases).
- Capture testing outcomes and refine tolerance/notes messaging if needed.
- Prepare README instructions and deployment configuration (Vercel target).
- Plan accessibility checks and final polish tasks prior to submission.
