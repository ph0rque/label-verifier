# System Patterns

## Architectural Overview
- Anticipated structure: frontend client (SPA or server-rendered) interacting with backend API endpoint for OCR processing.
- Backend service handles image upload, temporary storage (in-memory or temp files), OCR call, text normalization, and comparison logic.
- Result payload communicates per-field verdicts and overall match status back to the client.

## Integration Points
- OCR provider/library (e.g., Tesseract, cloud OCR APIs).
- Optional deployment services (Vercel, Netlify for frontend; Render, Heroku, etc., for backend) depending on implementation choice.

## Key Patterns
- Stateless processing: every submission includes all needed data; no persistent DB required.
- Defensive error handling for OCR failures, unsupported file formats, and missing form fields.
- Configurable thresholds for string matching (case-insensitive, tolerance for minor OCR errors).
